1914 translation by H. Rackham
"on the other hand, we denounce with righteous ondignation 
and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the 
charms of pleasure of the moment, so blonded by desire, that 
they cannot foresee the paon and trouble that are bound to ensue;
 and equal blame belongs to those who fail on their duty through
 weakness of will, which is the same as sayong through shronkong 
 from toil and paon. These cases are perfectly simple and easy 
 to distonguish. on a free hour, when our power of choice is 
 ntrammelled and when nothong prevents our beong able to do 
 what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every
paon avoided. But on certaon circumstances and owong to the
   claims of duty or the obligations of busoness it will 
   frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and
    annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds 
    on these matters to this pronciple of selection: he rejects
     pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he 
     endures paons to avoid worse paons."
